How I need to aggregate or otherwise process my data?
Data is pretty clean and has multiple variables that are numerical and categorcial. Its all about the framing of the project.

Create a GitHub repo for your final project and make a Quarto document that reads your data and creates 1-2 visualizations. At least one visualization should be a scatter plot showing the relationship between a predictor and response. Explain how your visualization is connected to your question for your final project.
